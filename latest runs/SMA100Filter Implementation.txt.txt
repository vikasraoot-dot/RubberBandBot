Right now I have 15min stock and options live bots running on live market (through github action work flow) and trading. I want you to be the astute monitor/auditor bot (just observing and taking note) on the performance and decisions it's taking. E.g If it skips a trade , I want you to log it and also track what if it would have taken that trade, how things would have panned out. If it takes trade, then do a similar thing but instead what would have happened if it had skipped that trade(would it result in Profit or loss at the end of the day). Create a artifact/logger/tracker for it for the the two bots, but I want you to draw results in parallel universes where things would have been different than what the current bots are doing. Goal is to then analyze results and benchmark our bot performnances based on how well they did and if they need to be tweaked or left untouched. I want this logger/tracker to persist, so save it locally and keep adding to it your observations with detailed logging (date/time/trade/conditions met or unmet/ what if etc) so that when we do post analysis deep dives you have everything handy. You can keep the tracking interval to 15mins just like how bots trade so you are not adding too much verbosity in terms of lines of logs- But each line you add should be super rich in content and attribiutes and data points so all relevant and possible relevant data is available to you. You need to just be an observer of these two bots that are running and read their logs to see how they are doing. You should also hit the alpaca broker end point to cross check the actions, positions and activities it shows so you can cross- relate.

Exploration and Planning
I identified the relevant bot scripts. Now I am reading 
live_paper_loop.py
 and 
live_spreads_loop.py
 to understand their logging formats and decision-making logic, which is crucial for the auditor bot to parse their actions.

Progress Updates
1
Exploring codebase to understand existing bots and logging mechanisms.

2
Checking RubberBand/scripts and logs directory content.

3
Reading bot scripts to understand logging.

Creating Implementation Plan
I have analyzed the bot scripts and defined the strategy for the Auditor Bot (Shadow Ledger). I need to verify the config.yaml to confirm file paths. Then I will create the implementation_plan.md detailing the Auditor Bot's architecture, including log monitoring, shadow trading logic, and persistence.

Implementation Plan
Progress Updates
1
Checking config.yaml and creating implementation_plan.md

I have analyzed the existing bots and designed the Auditor Bot. It will run in parallel, monitoring logs, and simulating "shadow trades" for both missed opportunities (Skips) and alternative outcomes (Entries).

Please review the implementation plan.

Implementing Auditor Bot Script
I am writing the auditor_bot.py script. It will tail log files, maintain a shadow portfolio of 'inverted' decisions (taking trades the bot skipped, skipping trades the bot took), and persist the state to auditor_state.json.

Writing auditor_bot.py script.

Verifying Auditor Bot
I confirmed the log file pattern is options_trades_*.jsonl. I am now updating 
auditor_bot.py
 and proceeding with the dry-run.

auditor_bot.py
Progress Updates
1
Checking log file locations and running a dry-run test of auditor_bot.py.

2
Checking log file naming convention in live_spreads_loop.py and correcting auditor_bot.py.

3
Updating auditor_bot.py with correct log pattern and running dry-run.
